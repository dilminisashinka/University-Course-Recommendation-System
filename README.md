# University Course Recommendation System

This application serves as a course recommender system based on collaborative filtering. It recommends courses to users by finding similar profiles, using the Streamlit framework to create a user-friendly web service.

- **SQL Integration**: User data, course information, and course registration data are stored in MySQL.

## Tech Used
- **Language**: Python
- **Web Framework**: Streamlit
- **Database**: MySQL
- **Algorithm**: Collaborative Filtering
- **Configuration**: `config.toml`, `secrets.toml`
